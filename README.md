The application provides core functionalities such as user authentication, news posting, fetching, and deletion, allowing users to log in, post news stories, and delete their own stories. The API supports filtering news by category, region, and date and enforces strict authentication to maintain secure access. A command-line client written in Python interacts with the API, enabling seamless command-driven interaction for login, posting, fetching, and deleting news stories. The project utilises Djangoâ€™s ORM for database management and includes error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.
